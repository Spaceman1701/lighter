/**
 * Annotations for declarative application modeling. These annotations provide
 * the core API for lighter. Includes annotations for describing endpoints, describing
 * resource controllers, and declaring request guard factories.
 * <br><br>
 * Lighter's declarative API is similar in some respects to the JAX-RS declarative API.
 * However, Lighter's API has far fewer annotations and is capable of properly describing
 * applications of similar (if not greater) complexity.
 * <br><br>
 * Lighter's declarative API attempts to be unobtrusive. Thus, the API avoids verbose
 * constructs like parameter-targeted annotations whenever possible.
