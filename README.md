# Lighter

A lightweight Java microframework for humans

## What is This (And should I use this)?

I decided to roll my own stack for a school project.

Probably don't use it (yet). If I like the direction it's going I might keep maintaining it.

## Goals

- Compile Time Verification
- Fast Startup Times
- Easy Handler Composition
